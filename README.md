## Calendar of Wisdom

This project was inspired by the 'Calendar of Wisdom' book from Russian author Lev Tolstoy. 

I have gained a lot of benefit from these daily entries of wisdom curated by Tolstoy, so I thought it would be a fun project to get an online version up and running as well. 

The purpose of this project was also to improve my frontend web development skills. Prior to this project, I had never used React/NextJS. It has been a steep learning curve! 

I also enjoyed learning about various aspects of config/CI/CD for this project. The posts themselves are stored in an AmazonS3 bucket, so there was a lot to learn regarding how to fetch those. 

The project is currently hosted on Amplify (url incoming!). 

Still under development, so lots of little bits to do:

- Posts have to be manually created, still in the process of doing this! 
- Implement an about page. 
- Fix typescript errors. I am currently bypassing these using the dreaded 'any'. 
- Implement e2e tests, and configure them to run in GitHub Actions. 

Thanks for reading!
